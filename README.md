Hello and welcome to my Minecraft-inspired portfolio! Here, I've crafted a nostalgic journey into the pixelated world of Minecraft, showcasing my passion and creativity through various projects throughout the Fall 2023 semester.

## Components

### 1. Homepage

The homepage of my portfolio is inspired by the design/aesthetic of Minecraft's welcome page. From the buttons to the font, I tried my best immitate & replicate all details from the original game. The majority, if not all, components are designed vis Adobe Illustrator (SVG Images).

### 2. Interactive Map

When clicking on the About button you will be welcomed to explore a map that is designed to highlight my four main projects. 

### 3. Pixelated Paintings

By clicking the map, you will land on the projects page where pixelated images capture the essence of Minecraft's pixelated art style. These painting/image frames will then lead you to my work.

### 4. Game Over Page
To end this experienc,e a user may quit and that'll lead to a page that mirrors the familiar Minecraft game over screen, offering a touch of nostalgia for those who have spent hours in the virtual world.

### 5. Original Minecraft Sound

The website allows users to listen to the original Minecraft sound as you navigate the portfolio. The audio adds an authentic touch, bringing the Minecraft-inspired environment to life and creating a memorable experience. Buttons also have audio all throughout.

### 6. 3D Animation

Explore the challenging 3D animation on the main page. The animation encapsulates the spirit of Minecraft, reflecting the effort put into aligning and duplicating details from the original game. Main page was not entirely made from scratch, it is used from external resources linked below with minor adjustments.

## Challenges

### - Clickable Elements

Crafting clickable elements that respond was challenging. Balancing user experience while staying true to the Minecraft theme required careful consideration of interaction design.

### - Cursor Image

Implementing a custom cursor image presented unexpected hurdles. Despite efforts, changing the cursor image to align with the Minecraft theme posed technical difficulties.

### - Audio Reliability

Incorporating the original Minecraft sound enhanced the immersive experience. However, occasional issues with audio reliability surfaced.

## Reflection

Despite the challenges, I am very proud of the outcome of this Minecraft-themed portfolio. While my initial vision included even more details from the game, the final result is a heartfelt journey into a beloved childhood memory. All in all, this portfolio shows my passion for UX design.
